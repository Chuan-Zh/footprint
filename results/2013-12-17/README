Hongwei's score

Originally, Hongwei's socre is at gene level and covered only ~2500 genes which have GO 
notation, so we need to put it to operon level.
The are there way to compute Hongwei's score at operon level:
1 by taking average
2 by transfer a gene to operon directly
3 by use the first gene in an operon to stand for that operon
