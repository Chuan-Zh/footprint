Filter out the motifs that does not contains sites from E.coli, use the new graph for clustering.

Check the distribution of similarity and zscore.

The original graph is top_20_inter_12-20_top_10_motif.tsv, top 20 sequences of intergeneric region,
motif lenght 12 - 20, keep top 10 motifs.

All closures files:
top_20_inter_12_20_top_10

python filter_motif.py > filtered_graph_top_20_inter_12-20_top_10_motif.tsv
