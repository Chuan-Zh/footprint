Filter out the motifs that does not contains sites from E.coli, use the new graph for clustering.


The original graph is top_20_inter_12-20_top_10_motif.tsv, top 20 sequences of intergeneric region,
motif lenght 12 - 20, keep top 10 motifs.

All closures files:
top_20_inter_12_20_top_10


Filter out the motifs that are not significant in E.coli genome.
Scan all found motifs in the E.coli promoter sequences, with whole genomes as background.
Get the p-value, zscore and enrichment for each motifs, find some cutoff to remove 
non-significant motifs.
