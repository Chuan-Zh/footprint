reg_table_all.txt is the analysis for the new multigraph and regulon subgraph.
reg_table_0.5sim.txt  is the same analysis when build the graph but with a similarity cutoff. ( with motif_graph.py)

ortholog_and_motif_count.tsv is a count for ortholog and motifs numbers for each gene. with ortholog_motif_inRegulon_count.pl

Scripts for pick information from raw closure compare output:
To operon table: nodes are operon
closurecompare2operontable.pl

To motif table: nodes are motif
closurecompare2table.pl

Add degree and common neighbour number to above two table to assist analysis and clustering:
(some of these are ran on zcluter ~/footprint_share to spead up)
