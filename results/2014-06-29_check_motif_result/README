2014-06-29 check the results of bobro
-----------------------------------------
Get bobro data from zcluster: /home/xynlab/zchuan/footprint/run_bobro/top_20_inter_12_20_top_10
top 20 intergenetic promoters with a operon similarity score, find motif of length from 12 to 20 and keep only the top 10 motif.
data/2014-06-29_motif_finding_result

First picked some members of PurR and CRP, and get their motif finding results
from ortholog promoters.
Original results in: top_20_inter_12_20_top_10
picked_regulon.txt

Draw all the motifs logos and pick the one match with the real regulon motif
pick_CRP
pick_PurR

Check the pairwise bbc compare results from
../2014-05-21/top_10_motif_graph.tsv
check_PurR


For PurR, 5 out of 8 operon have the right motif:
16129025_6
16130248_3
16130424_7
16128507_4
16128507_7
16129616_1
And all these motifs contains sites from E.coli.
There should be at least 10 pairs be in the graph:
16129025_6  Not found
16130248_3 with 16130424_7 16128507_4 16129616_1
16130424_7 with 16128507_4 16129616_1
16128507_4 with 16129616_1
Seems pretty good.
