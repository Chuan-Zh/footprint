Check the filtered motif graph
===================================

The filtered graph is:
filtered_graph_top_20_inter_12-20_top_10_motif.tsv
3046 nodes
220709 edges

Check the filtered motif graph by adding edges progressively

python tsv2db.py
python regulon_cluster_by_top_edges.py
regulon_cluster_pdf

MCL clustering and check cluster and regulon overlap
run_mcl.pl
mcl_cluster

run_mcl_with_cut.pl
mcl_cluster_z8_s.3
mcl_cluster_z8_s.5

Checked the distribution of similarity and zscore 
stat/stat.r

If we only keep the edges that are marked in the same regulon, then the clustering is very good. So removing false edges maybe a promising way.
