We first evaluate the functional rela-
tionship between two genes from three different
perspectivesâ€”phylogenetic profile analysis, gene
neighborhood analysis and Gene Ontology assign-
ments. We then combine the three different sources
of information in the framework of Bayesian inference,
and we use the combined information to measure the
strength of gene functional relationship.
