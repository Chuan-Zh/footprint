RESULTS part (a)
======================
(a) The basic stats of orthologous operons using E. coli as target genome (Two distributions)

1. Local regulon or operon not in regulon cannot get enough supporting in host genome

draw regulon size dist with stat.r

* regulon_size.txt
* reg_size_dist_bin1.pdf
* reg_size_dist_bin_default.pdf

2. The orthologous promoters can benefit the footprinting motif finding

count ortholog operon number from number of ortholog promoters found: 
for i in ortholog_opr_promoter_300/*;do echo -n $i; grep '>' $i | wc; done | sed -e 's/ortholog_opr_promoter_300\///' > ortholog_opr_count.txt

draw orthologous operon number distribution with stat.r

* orth_opr_count_bin2.pdf
* orth_opr_count_less216_bin1.pdf
* orth_opr_count_less216_bin2.pdf

There are operon with more than 216 orthologs, may caused by their large size
about 84.3% of operons with more than 10 ortholog
