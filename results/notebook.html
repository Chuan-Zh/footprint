        <p>After reading the paper 'A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology
        Projects', I decide to reorgnize things in the way as suggested in this paper.</p>

        <p>Build the directory struct, move all the old results to results/2013-09-01/</p>
        <p>Set up git and ignore list</p>
