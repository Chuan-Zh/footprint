clustering results
===================================
The test graph, only keep edges recored to be in a regulon, is nearly noiseless.
data source:
maqin@zcluster:~/Collaboration/RegulonPrediction/results/cluster-Qin-07062014

MCL results seems to be better,  e.g. mcl_cluster_vs_regulon/edge_1_1.4.tsv
Other method tend to output smaller cluster.

EASE Score, a modified Fisher Exact P-Value

With compare_regulon_cluster.py:
Compare a regulon (as operon set) with a mcl cluster(as set of motifs, 
transfer to operon set) with hypergeometric distribution, overlap coefficient 
(overlap_coe = |intersection(X, Y)| / min(|X|, |Y|) ) and 
(overlap_coe2 = |intersection(X, Y)| / |union(X, Y)| ) .
p-value corresponds to Fisher Exact test, EASE score is a modified Fisher Exact test.
