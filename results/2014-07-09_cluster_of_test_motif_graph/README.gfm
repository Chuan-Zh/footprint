clustering results
===================================

Data
--------------------------------
The test graph, only keep edges recored to be in a regulon, is nearly noiseless.
data source:
maqin@zcluster:~/Collaboration/RegulonPrediction/results/cluster-Qin-07062014
edge_1 is for test graph similarity
edge_2 is for test graph zscore
edge_3 is for whole graph similarity
edge_4 is for whole graph zscore


Process
------------------------------------
perl runall.pl
When run with different parameters, first run:
bash clean_up_old_results.sh
Change the parameters in 
compare_regulon_cluster.py
count_mcl_cluster_size.pl
And then perl runall.pl

Results
-------------------------------------------
MCL
mcl_cluster_vs_regulon
edge_1_2.0.tsv and edge_2_2.0.tsv work best.
edge_3 and edge_4 work poor.

with-index
with_index_cluster_vs_regulon
For edge_1, edge_1_J_K_300.tsv works best.
For edge_2, edge_2_C_300.tsv do. edge_1 is better than edge_2.
edge_3 and edge_4 work poor.


without-index
without_index_cluster_vs_regulon
For edge_1, edge_1_300_K.tsv and edge_1_300.tsv work best, little worse than with-index method
For edge_2, edge_2_300_K.tsv best.
edge_3 and edge_4 work poor.

Overall, MCL for edge_1_2.0.tsv works best. 
edge_3 and edge_4 work poor.

Score
----------------------------------

EASE Score, a modified Fisher Exact P-Value

With compare_regulon_cluster.py:
Compare a regulon (as operon set) with a mcl cluster(as set of motifs, 
transfer to operon set) with hypergeometric distribution, overlap coefficient 
(overlap_coe = |intersection(X, Y)| / min(|X|, |Y|) ) and 
(overlap_coe2 = |intersection(X, Y)| / |union(X, Y)| ) .
p-value corresponds to Fisher Exact test, EASE score is a modified Fisher Exact test.
